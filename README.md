# ProductRatingWeb
**ProductRatingWeb** is an open-source online application that can be used to store data about food products in structured form.

Nowadays, there are many products available on the market. Consumers tend to try out new products but not all of them are good enough to stay with them for longer. On the other hand, people may have some loved products but each of them might do better on different occassion. What if a product tastes really well but contains a hell of preservatives and should not be eaten on a daily basis? Oh, there is also a price that may play a role while deciding to buy a product. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to remember all these information in a single mind. Well, unless you are an :alien:...

So here comes the ProductRatingWeb. This application was designed to store all these information for you and make them available anytime.
